summary: "A collection of red flags in software engineers' test assignments"
---

It’s 2025 and you are applying for a software engineer position. They give you a test assignment. You complete it yourself, send it over, and get rejected. Why?

Because it looked like AI.

Unfortunately, it’s 2025, AI is spreading like glitter in a kindergarten, and it’s really easy to mistake hard human labor for soulless, uninspired machine slop.

Following are the main _red flags_ in test assignments that should be __avoided__:

- The assignment was read and understood in full.
- Industry-standard languages and frameworks are used.
- The code is split into small, readable functions.
- Variables have descriptive names.
- Complex parts have comments.
- Errors are handled, error messages are easy to follow.
- Source files are organized reasonably.
- The web interface looks nice.
- There are tests.

Avoid these mistakes yourself and spread the word!
